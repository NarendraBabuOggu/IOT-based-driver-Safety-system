# IOT-based-driver-Safety-system
The system continuously monitors driver and alerts him whenever he goes into sleep. Also a copy of sleeping driver is uploaded to cloud as part of IOT and future reference.
iot_driver_safety.py is the main code written in python. As the system uses only opencv and python 3, we can use this raspberry pi also.
